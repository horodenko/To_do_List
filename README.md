# To-do list app 



## Overview

This is a challenge proposed by _Digital Innovation One_, which involves developing a to-do list from scratch.

I made this application using the Dragon Age game images and references.

The first menu within the application is an empty state screen, of which is visible every time you open up the application whenever you don't have a task currently created.

The first screen includes:

- A title;
- An empty state message;
- Two SVG image files;
- A button to create a new task

As soon as you click the button, you will be redirected to the second screen containing several text fields, which you may use to inform a: 

- title
- description
- date
- time 

Looking at the footer, you can see two buttons: 

- Cancel
- Create

The first button is used in case you want to cancel your current task creation, so you can be redirected to the main menu/screen.  

The second one is used to create your task with all the information that you provided.

In case you selected the second button, you will be redirected to the first screen with your task created, informing the title and the time that you have chosen.

Beside the created task, you may see a vertical 'more' button, which includes upon clicked:

- Edit 
- Delete

The first option is used in case you want to change any information that you may have mistakenly provided.

As for the second one, you will delete your file completely.

## Notes



This is a project that i intend to continue working on, there are a great deal of things that i want to include, and bugs that i want to fix.



## Known bugs



- Nothing is changed upon editing a task;
- Every task is lost upon closing the application;
